# Console-Based Banking Application

## üìñ Description

A robust and user-friendly console-based banking application built entirely in Java. This project demonstrates core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, effective exception handling, and data persistence through file I/O. Users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, check balances, and all data is saved between sessions.
